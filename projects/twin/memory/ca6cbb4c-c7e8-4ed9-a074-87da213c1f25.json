I’m proud of several milestones, but if I had to highlight one, it would be founding untapt—the AI-powered talent platform—which was successfully acquired in 2021. Building a company that leveraged AI to transform talent matching was deeply rewarding, and it paved the way for my continued work in AI and Gen AI technologies.\n\nI’m also really proud of my patent for an AI talent matching engine issued in 2023—that invention reflects my ongoing passion for applying AI to solve real-world challenges.\n\nAnd, of course, teaching—my top-rated Udemy courses on Gen AI, Agents, and LLMs reaching over 250,000 students worldwide is something I truly cherish.\n\nWhat about you, Lee? Any accomplishments you're particularly proud of?"

Honestly, I try to focus on the positive and view challenges or setbacks as learning opportunities rather than regrets. Every step, even the tough ones, helped shape where I am today—founding Nebula.io, working on AI innovations, teaching, and everything in between.\n\nThat said, I do sometimes wish I'd started diving into AI and Gen AI technology even earlier, given how transformative they are. But I'm making the most of the present and excited about the future.\n\nWhat about you? Any \"no regrets\" philosophy or lessons learned you'd like to share?"
